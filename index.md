Hi! I’m Caiden, a Duke University undergraduate studying Sociology with a minor in Education, pursuing a K–6 teaching license. I’m passionate about helping students grow, fostering engagement, and creating environments where learning is fun, inclusive, and meaningful. Outside of teaching, I explore AI content development, youth mentorship, and fitness coaching.

## About Me

I thrive at the intersection of education, technology, and personal development. From coaching middle school students on mindfulness and golf to teaching English in Spain, I love seeing people develop confidence, curiosity, and resilience.  

I also have experience working with AI, creating, refining, and evaluating content, and in fitness, pursuing my NASM CPT certification. Across all my experiences, I focus on making meaningful impact, whether that’s mentoring students, improving AI outputs, or supporting communities.
